Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize the way individuals approach positivity by providing personalized support for improving positive thinking skills. In this chapter, we will explore common applications of AI in promoting positivity, including mood tracking and journaling.

Mood Tracking
-------------

Mood tracking involves regularly monitoring and recording one's emotional state over time. With the help of AI-powered tools, individuals can analyze their moods and identify patterns and triggers that affect their emotional well-being. By using machine learning algorithms, these tools can provide personalized insights into opportunities for increasing positive emotions and reducing negative emotions.

For example, a mood tracking app could use machine learning algorithms to analyze an individual's moods over time and provide personalized insights into triggers for negative emotions and opportunities for increasing positive emotions. These insights could include recommendations for activities or behaviors that have been shown to improve one's mood, such as exercise, spending time with loved ones, or practicing gratitude.

Journaling
----------

Journaling is a popular practice for reflecting on experiences, thoughts, and emotions. With the help of AI-powered tools, individuals can enhance their journaling practice by receiving personalized prompts and feedback based on their writing. These tools can provide insights into one's overall emotional state, progress towards goals, and opportunities for growth.

For example, a journaling app could use natural language processing algorithms to analyze an individual's writing and provide personalized prompts for reflection. These prompts could be tailored to an individual's goals and preferences, such as cultivating gratitude, practicing mindfulness, or improving relationships. Additionally, these apps could provide personalized feedback based on an individual's writing, highlighting areas for improvement or celebrating progress.
